# 1. Onboarding Dashboard

**Status:** in-review

One screen serving two states, confirmed by QA (2026-08-27) as a single
feature rather than two: the Home screen shows an **onboarding/empty state**
for merchants with zero offers, and switches to a **dashboard** once the
merchant has at least one offer. Analyzed against Jira 2026-08-27 (QVD-14,
QVD-18, QVD-27, QVD-31, QVD-65, QVD-66, QVD-115, QVD-135) — see Related Jira
Tickets below. Note: QVD-31 (Jul 2025) specified a warning **banner** for the
"extension not enabled" state; QVD-66 (Aug 2025, later) explicitly replaced
it with a permanent status block and says to remove the banner — the
sections below reflect the QVD-66 (current) behavior, with QVD-31 kept only
for the still-relevant deep-link mechanism.

## Purpose

Get a new merchant to create their first volume discount offer with minimal
friction (activation), and give returning merchants a working hub to
monitor/manage offers. Also a **Built for Shopify (B4S) compliance
requirement**: Shopify's app review explicitly flagged that onboarding must
be visible immediately after install (QVD-135) — this is not just a UX nice-to-have.

## Business Rules

- **Trigger condition:** onboarding view shows automatically only for
  first-time users with **zero existing offers**. Once a merchant has ≥1
  offer, onboarding no longer shows automatically — the dashboard view takes
  over (QVD-18 AC). **Resolved (QA confirmed 2026-08-28):** "existing
  offers" counts any offer regardless of status (paused/expired, etc. —
  note: offers have **no "draft" status** in this app), not active only —
  consistent with the "Recently created offers" list, which also shows
  offers of any status.
- **B4S requirement (QVD-135):** onboarding must render on the Home screen
  immediately post-install, with a step-by-step setup guide and clear
  primary CTAs — this was a direct fix for a Shopify review flag, so
  regressions here carry App Store risk, not just a UX bug.
- **Onboarding view contents (QVD-18):** header "Hello {{Store name}}!",
  primary button "Create offer", empty-state card "Create your first deal!"
  / "Create your first volume discount offer to get started." / "Create offer" button.
- **Dashboard view contents (QVD-27),** 3 sections:
  1. **Theme Extension Status** — see detailed spec below (QVD-66).
  2. **Setup Guide** — see detailed spec below (QVD-65).
  3. **"Recently created offers"** — **corrected per QA (2026-08-28), differs
     from QVD-27's spec:** lists the **5 most recently created offers**,
     regardless of status (not the paginated table with Name/Status/Trigger/
     Combination/Actions columns that QVD-27 originally specified). "Manage
     offers" and "Create offer" buttons for navigation.
- **Theme Extension Status block — current behavior (QVD-66, supersedes the
  QVD-31 banner):** a **permanent** block on the dashboard page (always
  visible, regardless of offer/extension state) showing whether offers are
  live on the storefront:
  - **Active:** status "Active"; helper text "The created offer is visible
    on your storefront."; "Need help?" button opens in-app chat with
    customer support.
  - **Inactive:** status "Inactive"; helper text "The created offer is not
    visible on your storefront because the app embed is inactive."; "Need
    help?" button (same as above) plus an **"Enable theme app"** button
    that opens the Shopify Theme Editor to enable the extension.
  - **Explicitly removed:** the separate warning banner from QVD-31 (which
    appeared transiently after offer creation if the extension wasn't
    enabled) — QVD-66 states it's redundant with this permanent block and
    should be removed "to avoid annoyance." If a warning banner is ever
    seen in addition to this block, that's a regression back to QVD-31
    behavior, not a new feature.
  - **Deep-link mechanism (from QVD-31, still applies to the "Enable theme
    app" button here):** clicking it redirects to the Shopify **Theme
    Editor in a new tab**, auto-selects "the correct theme", auto-inserts
    the app block ("Qikify: Volume Discount") into the relevant section
    (typically product page), and instructs the merchant to click **Save**
    to apply. **Resolved (QA confirmed 2026-08-28):** "the correct theme"
    = the theme currently active/published on the storefront.
- **Setup Guide — current behavior (QVD-65):**
  - Progress tracker at the top (e.g. "1/2 completed"), updates dynamically
    as steps complete. **Resolved** (was a `Need confirm` before QVD-65 was
    reviewed): once both steps are done, tracker shows "2/2 completed" and
    the **setup guide collapses**.
  - **Step 1 — Create your offer:** description "Start by creating an offer
    that matches your sales strategy. Set product conditions, define
    discount levels, and customize how your promotion will appear to
    shoppers."; button "Create offer" (Primary) → opens offer settings page.
  - **Step 2 — Enable theme app extensions:** description "Enable theme app
    extension to make the created offer visible on your storefront. Open
    theme editor > Click Save button."; button "Enable theme app extension"
    (Primary) → opens theme editor (same deep-link mechanism as the Theme
    Extension Status block's button, above).
- **Dashboard ATC click stat (QVD-115):** shows add-to-cart click count for
  the last 30 days. **Cross-reference:** this metric functionally overlaps
  with the standalone [Analytics feature](08-analytics.md) — treat as "a
  metric hosted on the dashboard," not core onboarding/dashboard logic. See
  note added to `08-analytics.md`.

## Edge Cases

- Merchant with 0 offers → onboarding shown. Merchant creates their first
  offer → **Resolved (QA confirmed 2026-08-28):** creating the offer does
  **not** auto-redirect to Home/Dashboard — the merchant stays on the offer
  settings page. The switch to Dashboard only happens the next time the
  merchant navigates back to Home themselves.
- Merchant deletes their only offer, returning to 0 offers — **Resolved (QA
  confirmed 2026-08-28):** onboarding does **not** reappear; once a store
  has ever had ≥1 offer, the dashboard view persists even after all offers
  are deleted.
- Reinstall: **Resolved (QA confirmed 2026-08-28):** depends on whether the
  store instance ever created an offer. If the instance never created an
  offer before, onboarding shows again after reinstall. If it previously
  created an offer (even one later deleted), onboarding stays hidden and
  the dashboard shows instead.
- Theme app extension toggled from the Shopify theme editor directly
  (outside this app) — **Resolved (QA confirmed 2026-08-28):** yes, the
  Theme Extension Status block reflects it without any action inside the
  app.
- Store name with unusual values (very long, special characters, emoji) in
  "Hello {{Store name}}!" header — truncation/overflow.
- Large number of offers — since "Recently created offers" caps at 5 (not
  paginated, per correction above), confirm it always shows the 5 *most
  recent* and drops older ones as new offers are created.
- Rapid repeated clicks on "Create offer" CTA — **Resolved (QA confirmed
  2026-08-28):** not applicable/no risk — the first click already
  navigates away to the offer-type selection page, so there's no window
  for a second click to register on the same button.
- Multiple staff accounts on the same store viewing Home simultaneously —
  **Resolved (QA confirmed 2026-08-28):** state is store-wide but not
  push/live-updated. If staff A creates an offer while staff B already has
  Home open, staff B keeps seeing Onboarding until they **reload** — no
  automatic real-time switch.
- Store with multiple themes (published + drafts) — **Resolved (QA
  confirmed 2026-08-28):** "Enable theme app" targets the theme currently
  active/published on the storefront (see Business Rules above). Still
  worth a regression check that it never targets a draft/unpublished theme.
- Merchant clicks "Enable theme app"/"Enable theme app extension", the new
  tab opens to Theme Editor, but the merchant closes it or navigates away
  **without** clicking Save — **Resolved (QA confirmed 2026-08-28):** yes,
  the status block correctly still shows "Inactive".
- **Regression check:** does the old QVD-31 warning banner ever reappear
  alongside the QVD-66 permanent status block? It was explicitly removed as
  redundant — if both show, that's a bug, not a feature.
- Both Setup Guide steps completed — **Resolved (QA confirmed 2026-08-28):**
  tracker shows "2/2 completed" and the guide collapses by default; the
  merchant can click to expand it again to view the steps.

## Risks (from /analysis, 2026-08-27)

- **High — B4S compliance regression:** QVD-135 exists because Shopify's
  own review flagged this. A regression here risks Built for Shopify
  standing, not just a normal UX bug — treat as a priority regression area.
- **Medium — Theme Extension Status staleness:** if the app doesn't
  correctly poll/sync the real Shopify theme editor state, merchants could
  be misled about whether their offers are actually live on the storefront.
- **Medium — onboarding/dashboard trigger edge cases:** the 0-vs-≥1-offer
  binary condition (now resolved: any status counts, deletion doesn't
  revert to onboarding) still has real regression consequences both
  directions — worth solid coverage even though the ambiguity is gone (see
  Edge Cases).

## Testability Notes

Per [`qikify-volume.md` QA app note](../dev-references/references.md): **no
API access for QA automation** — everything here must be verified through
the UI manually (Playwright MCP browser-driven only, no
`APIRequestContext`). Practical implications:
- Onboarding↔dashboard switching: verifiable via UI (create/delete test
  offers, reload Home).
- Theme Extension Status accuracy: verifiable via UI, but needs a test
  store/theme where the extension can be deliberately toggled — may need
  Dev/Support help to set up.
- "Enable theme app" deep link (QVD-31 mechanism): fully verifiable via UI —
  click button, confirm it opens Theme Editor in a new tab with the app
  block ("Qikify: Volume Discount") pre-inserted into the expected section,
  and that saving there flips the dashboard's status to Active on return.
- Banner-removal regression check (QVD-66): verifiable via UI — deactivate
  the extension and confirm only the permanent status block reacts, no
  separate warning banner appears.
- ATC click count (QVD-115): correctness of the underlying computation is
  not verifiable from the UI alone (would need real storefront ATC events
  or log/dev access) — at most, smoke-test that a number renders.
- B4S "immediately after install" requirement: only testable via an actual
  fresh install (or uninstall/reinstall cycle) on a test store.
